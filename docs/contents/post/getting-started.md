# What is Wasp?

Wasp is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Wasp is a static site generator. Unlike other systems which dynamically build a page every time a visitor requests one, Wasp does the building when you create your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is optimized for website viewing while providing a great writing experience.
